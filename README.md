# Text Analytics Project â€“ Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and underwent extensive preprocessing before applying various word embedding methods and deep learning models.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python (NLTK, spaCy, Gensim, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn)
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, Regex, NLTK, SpaCy
- **Word Embeddings:** Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** Neural Networks (TensorFlow/Keras)
- **Visualization:** WordCloud, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Highlights
- **Dataset:** Amazon product reviews dataset from Kaggle.
- **Preprocessing Techniques:**
  - Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal
  - TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words (BoW) feature extraction
- **Word Embeddings:**
  - Implemented Word2Vec and GloVe for vector representations.
  - Extracted contextual embeddings from BERT.
- **Modeling:**
  - Applied a simple Neural Network for sentiment classification.
  - Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
